const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between sheetrock and drywall?',
    answer: "Sheetrock is actually a brand name (owned by USG Corporation) that has become synonymous with drywall, much like Kleenex for tissues. They refer to the same product - gypsum panels used to create interior walls and ceilings. We use high-quality sheetrock and drywall products interchangeably based on your project's needs.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does sheetrock hanging take?',
    answer: 'Hanging time depends on the project scope. A single room typically takes a few hours to a day, while a whole house can take several days. We provide accurate timelines during your free estimate based on square footage, ceiling heights, and complexity.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you provide the sheetrock or do I need to buy it?',
    answer: 'We can handle everything including materials, or you can supply your own sheetrock if preferred. When we provide materials, we ensure proper thickness, type (standard, moisture-resistant, fire-rated), and quantity for your project.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What thickness of sheetrock do you recommend?',
    answer: "For most residential walls, 1/2-inch sheetrock is standard. Ceilings often use 5/8-inch for added rigidity. Fire-rated areas require 5/8-inch Type X sheetrock. We'll recommend the right specifications during your consultation.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you hang sheetrock on ceilings too?',
    answer: 'Ceiling sheetrock installation is one of our specialties. We use proper techniques and equipment to ensure secure fastening and smooth surfaces, whether for standard flat ceilings or more complex layouts.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What areas in Central Minnesota do you serve?',
    answer: 'We provide sheetrock hanging services throughout Central Minnesota, including St. Cloud, Clear Lake, Sartell, Sauk Rapids, Waite Park, Cold Spring, Monticello, and surrounding communities.',
